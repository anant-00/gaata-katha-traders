      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>
        Gaata Katha Traders was born from a love for heritage, clean living, and the hands that keep ancient crafts alive. 
        When we began, our vision was simple — to connect people with products that carried the soul of tradition while serving the needs of modern living.
      </p>
      <p>
        The pandemic struck like a silent storm, shutting down markets, halting production, and severing supply chains. 
        But the deepest wound was personal — we lost many of our hardworking weavers and farmers — the quiet, uncelebrated backbone of any country.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yet from that loss grew an unshakable resolve. We chose not to let their work, their traditions, and their spirit fade away. 
        Gaata Katha Traders was reimagined as a social enterprise — one that would rebuild livelihoods and honor the people behind every product.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, Gaata Katha Traders LLC proudly partners with women-driven small farms and looms across India, helping them transition to organic farming and natural dye weaving. 
        Every purchase supports clean eating, healthy living, and the preservation of culture — from our grandmother’s kitchen to your table.
